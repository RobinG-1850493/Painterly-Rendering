-- Update, show simple/spline renderer
    - show saved images

-- Expansions:
    - Texturing
    - Simulate different techniques (Watercolor, oil, marbling, pencil)
    - Real-Time rendering on GPU (opengl, cuda, ...)
    - Painterly Rendering by relaxation
    - Particle Algorithm (Can look really good), use of textures representing paint brush styles
    - Image Segmentation (Build painting in sections, separate foreground background) -- vb houses.
    - Create application for multiple approaches (package)
    - Improve upon Hertzman (Adding layers, texturing, simulate paint brush roughness)
